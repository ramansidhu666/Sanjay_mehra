                            <p>I have more then two decades of experience in the field of ARCHITECTURE and CONSTRUCTION. My passion for finding the right home for my family combined with my love for real estate, home design, and affordability, lead me to a career in REALTY, which allows me to help others to find a home which meets their needs and compliments their lifestyle. 
I provide INTERIOR DESIGN  layouts for clients who wish to remodel and renovate portions of their home prior to listing for free. </p>
                            <p>Helping my clients with material selection for interiors, exteriors and landscaping is always my pleasure. </p>
                            <p>I understand what it is like to stand in my clients' shoes. Relocating several times - buying and selling houses of my own - has afforded me sensitivity towards my clients' journey, which can be attributed to the first-hand perspective I gained through my personal experience.</p>
                            <p>My knowledge in VASTU SHASTRA is a cherry on the cake  as I provide this service to my esteemed clients for free.</p>
                            <p> I'm into what I do, it’s part of who I am. The end game is my clients' success, which builds my success.</p>
